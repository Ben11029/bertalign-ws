事实上，与其你担心妄语，你可以正语啊。
Instead of worrying about lying, one can choose to practice Right Speech.
因为那位信徒是开布店，有人要买布了，就会问他：「布多少钱一尺？」
Once there was a Buddhist who owned a textile store, and when customers wanted to buy a piece of cloth, they would ask, “How much for a foot of fabric?”
「五块钱。」
“Five dollars.”
「褪色不褪色？」
“Does the color fade?”
为了要能卖出去，他只有说谎：「不褪色。」
To sell the cloth, he would lie and say, “No, it doesn’t.”
后来我告诉他，你不要这样说，你可以说：「五块钱的会褪色，另外有个八块钱的不褪色。」
Later, I told him not to respond that way. Instead, I suggested that he could say, “The five-dollar fabric fades easily, but the eight dollar one does not.”
后来这位信徒盖了大楼，就是因为他的诚信，不妄语，让他生意兴隆。
Due to the honorable reputation he gained from being honest, his business boomed, which allowed him to build an establishment.
我只是觉得奇怪，这么好的佛法，为什么不把它作为积极的解说，让信徒受到佛法的利益呢？
Dharma brings goodness to all. My only concern is, why do people not positively explain Buddhism so devotees can receive the benefit of the Dharma?
